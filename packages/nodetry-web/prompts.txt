consider the following JSON object as generated by a node editor UI and generate a poem following the nodes

{
    nodes: [
        {
            type: 'theme-node',
            value: 'love',
        },
        {
            type: 'meter-node',
            value: 'iambic-pentameter',
        },
        {
            type: 'rhyme-node',
            value: 'free-verse',
        },
        {
            type: 'abstraction-node',
            level: 0.9,
        }
    ]
}


just reply with the words of the poem, nothing else, don't mention the nodes or anything else, don't mention the rhyming scheme or meter, just the words of the poem, free verse means no rhyme, don't use rhymes if in free-verse






Sysytem
You will generate a poem from a JSON object. Respect very carefully the values of the nodes. Make sure if "free-verse" not to use rhymes. Make them short, 4 rows maximum.

In the dance of extremes,
Flames lick the silence, frost bites the void.
Neither pure rage nor cold reason reigns alone,
A universe breathes in fire and ice.
